# Requirements: Laminark v2.2 Debug Resolution Paths

**Defined:** 2026-02-14
**Core Value:** You never lose context — including the full debugging journey from problem to resolution.

## v2.2 Requirements

### Path Lifecycle

- [ ] **PATH-01**: System automatically detects debug sessions from error/failure patterns in PostToolUse stream
- [ ] **PATH-02**: System captures waypoints (error, attempt, failure, success, pivot, revert, discovery, resolution) during active debug paths
- [ ] **PATH-03**: System detects resolution when consecutive success signals meet threshold
- [ ] **PATH-04**: Debug paths persist in dedicated SQLite tables with ordered waypoints
- [ ] **PATH-05**: System tracks dead ends (attempted fixes that didn't work) as distinct waypoint types
- [ ] **PATH-06**: Debug paths link across session boundaries when continuing the same issue

### Intelligence

- [ ] **INTEL-01**: System generates KISS summary on path resolution ("next time, just do X")
- [ ] **INTEL-02**: KISS summaries include multi-layer dimensions (logical, programmatic, development)
- [ ] **INTEL-03**: System proactively surfaces relevant past debug paths when new debugging starts

### User Interface

- [ ] **UI-01**: MCP tool `path_start` explicitly starts a debug path
- [ ] **UI-02**: MCP tool `path_resolve` explicitly resolves active path
- [ ] **UI-03**: MCP tool `path_show` displays path with waypoints and summary
- [ ] **UI-04**: MCP tool `path_list` lists recent paths filtered by status
- [ ] **UI-05**: D3 graph overlay renders debug paths as animated breadcrumb trails
- [ ] **UI-06**: Path detail panel shows waypoints, summary, and linked entities
- [ ] **UI-07**: Toggle control to show/hide path overlay on graph

## Future Requirements

### Cross-Project
- **XPROJ-01**: Debug paths visible across project boundaries for related repos
- **XPROJ-02**: Shared memory pools for workspace-grouped projects

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Time-travel execution replay | Laminark observes at tool level, not runtime level |
| Git bisect integration | Different problem domain (commit-level bug localization vs session-level journey) |
| Manual debug notebooks | Contradicts "vibe tool" principle — zero manual intervention |
| Real-time debugging dashboard | Laminark is a memory system, not a monitoring system |
| Automatic fix application | Laminark observes and remembers, does not act on behalf of user |
| User-configurable detection rules | Ship sensible defaults first, tune based on real usage |

## Cross-Phase Integration

| # | Integration Point | Status |
|---|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Hook handler (P3) writes observations -> MCP server (P2) reads them | VERIFIED |
| 2 | MCP server (P2) creates AnalysisWorker (P4) -> embeds observations | VERIFIED |
| 3 | Embedding loop (P4) -> topic detection (P6) -> stash + notification | VERIFIED |
| 4 | Embedding loop (P4) -> entity extraction (P7) -> relationship detection | VERIFIED |
| 5 | SessionStart hook -> context injection (P5) -> stdout to Claude | VERIFIED |
| 6 | Stop hook -> session summary (P5) -> stored for next session | VERIFIED |
| 7 | MCP tools -> NotificationStore piggybacking (P6) -> consume-on-read | VERIFIED |
| 8 | Web server (P8) -> REST API reads DB -> SSE broadcasts from pipeline | VERIFIED |
| 9 | CurationAgent (P7) -> graph maintenance -> server lifecycle | VERIFIED |
| 10 | Slash commands (P5/P6) -> markdown files -> delegate to MCP tools | VERIFIED |

**10/10 integration points verified**

## E2E Flow Verification

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Observation lifecycle: tool use -> hook -> DB -> embed -> extract -> detect -> notify | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Session lifecycle: SessionStart context -> work -> Stop summary -> next session gets it | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Memory search: query -> recall tool -> hybrid search -> progressive disclosure -> response | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Topic stash/resume: shift detected -> stash -> notification -> resume | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Graph exploration: entities extracted -> query_graph -> web UI visualizes | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Web visualization: browser -> REST API -> Cytoscape -> SSE live updates | COMPLETE |

**6/6 E2E flows verified**

## Tech Debt

### Non-Critical Items (4 total)

**Phase 02: MCP Interface**
- UI-01 specified 5-7 separate MCP tools, but 2 unified tools (save_memory + recall) were implemented by explicit user decision. Functionally equivalent with better UX.

**Phase 05: Session Context**
- `commands/recall.md` line 14 references "search" MCP tool but actual tool is "recall". Functionally correct, documentation-level naming mismatch only.

**Phase 08: Web Visualization**
- 10 visual/interactive behaviors (dark theme, force-directed layout, node click panels, entity filtering, timeline layout, SSE status indicator, live updates, performance overlay, LOD zoom, viewport culling) verified at code level but need human browser testing for visual confirmation.
- No automated UI tests exist. Web UI functionality verified by code inspection and structural analysis only.

### Deferred to v2

None. All v1 requirements satisfied. v2 requirements (proactive resurfacing, conflict detection, export/import, advanced graph maintenance, multi-strategy curation) remain deferred as documented in REQUIREMENTS.md.

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 is ready to ship.**

- 51/51 requirements satisfied
- 8/8 phases verified (passed)
- 10/10 integration points verified
- 6/6 E2E flows complete
- 622 tests passing (100%)
- 4 minor tech debt items (none blocking)
- 10 human verification items for web UI visual/interactive behaviors

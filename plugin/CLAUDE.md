# Memory & Context

When you need to recall prior work, decisions, or context:
- **First** query Laminark's memory tools (`recall`, `query_graph`, `query_branches`) before resorting to grep/glob searches
- Use `recall` with keyword searches to find past observations, decisions, and findings
- Use `query_graph` to find relationships between files, decisions, and problems
- Use `query_branches` to see work history - what was investigated, fixed, built, and where it left off
- Use `show_branch` to trace the full arc of a specific work unit (investigation -> diagnosis -> planning -> execution -> verification)
- Use `save_memory` to persist important decisions, findings, and reference material
- Only fall back to raw file searches (Grep, Glob) when Laminark has no relevant results
